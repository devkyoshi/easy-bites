# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## Project Information
- **Repository:** Easy Bites Food Delivery Application
- **Tech Stack:** 
  - Backend: Spring Boot 3.4.0, Java 21, MySQL 8.0
  - Frontend: React 19.1.0, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
  - Architecture: Microservices with API Gateway
  - Authentication: JWT-based

## Executive Summary

This security assessment identified multiple vulnerabilities across the Easy Bites application, including insecure CORS configurations, CSRF protection disabled, insecure token storage, and dependency vulnerabilities. The application requires significant security improvements before production deployment to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insecure CORS Configuration
- **Severity:** High
- **Location:** 
  - `backend/auth-service/src/main/java/com/ds/authservice/config/SecurityConfig.java` (lines 39-54)
- **Description:** CORS is configured to allow all methods and headers with the wildcard (*) operator, creating potential for cross-origin attacks.
- **Evidence:**
  ```java
  corsConfiguration.addAllowedMethod("*");
  corsConfiguration.addAllowedHeader("*");
  ```
- **Impact:** Allows malicious websites to make requests to the API with users' authentication tokens, potentially leading to data theft or unauthorized actions.
- **Fix:** Restrict CORS to specific trusted origins, methods, and headers required by the application.

### 2. CSRF Protection Disabled
- **Severity:** High
- **Location:** All security configuration files, including `SecurityConfig.java` (line 27)
- **Description:** CSRF protection is explicitly disabled across all services.
- **Evidence:**
  ```java
  .csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable)
  ```
- **Impact:** Applications are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, where attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unwanted actions.
- **Fix:** Enable CSRF protection for state-changing operations or implement proper CSRF token validation.

### 3. Insecure Token Storage in Frontend
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** 
  - `web-app/src/stores/auth-context.tsx` (lines 98-99)
- **Description:** Authentication tokens are stored in localStorage, which is accessible to JavaScript and vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **Evidence:**
  ```typescript
  localStorage.setItem('auth_user', JSON.stringify(user))
  localStorage.setItem('access_token', accessToken)
  ```
- **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks could steal authentication tokens, leading to account takeover.
- **Fix:** Use HttpOnly cookies for token storage or implement proper token rotation with secure storage mechanisms.

### 4. Frontend Dependency Vulnerabilities
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** `web-app/package.json`
- **Description:** npm audit identified vulnerabilities in socket.io-client and related dependencies.
- **Evidence:**
  ```
  socket.io-client 2.3.1 - Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via parseuri dependency
  parseuri <2.0.0 - Vulnerable to ReDoS attacks
  engine.io-client 1.0.2 - 6.1.1 - Depends on vulnerable versions
  ```
- **Impact:** Potential for Denial of Service attacks against the application.
- **Fix:** Update the vulnerable dependencies to their latest secure versions.

### 5. Weak Password Requirements
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** Password validation in registration forms
- **Description:** While some password validation exists, it could be strengthened to better protect user accounts.
- **Evidence:**
  ```typescript
  password: z
    .string()
    .min(8, 'Minimum 8 characters')
    .regex(/[A-Z]/, 'At least one uppercase letter')
    .regex(/[0-9]/, 'At least one number')
  ```
- **Impact:** Users may create passwords that are susceptible to various attack methods like dictionary attacks.
- **Fix:** Enhance password requirements (increase minimum length, require special characters, implement password strength meters).

### 6. Missing Rate Limiting
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** Authentication endpoints
- **Description:** No evidence of rate limiting on critical endpoints like login and registration.
- **Impact:** Vulnerability to brute force attacks and credential stuffing.
- **Fix:** Implement rate limiting at the API Gateway or service level to prevent abuse.

### 7. Hardcoded JWT Secret Key
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Location:** Application properties files
- **Description:** JWT secret key appears to be stored in application properties, potentially in source control.
- **Evidence:** 
  - Secret loaded from properties file: `@Value("${jwt.secret-key}") private String SECRET;`
- **Impact:** If the secret key is exposed, attackers could forge valid JWT tokens and impersonate users.
- **Fix:** Store secrets in environment variables or a secure vault service, never in source code or config files.

### 8. Missing Secure Headers
- **Severity:** Low
- **Location:** HTTP responses
- **Description:** Security headers like Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options are not configured.
- **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to clickjacking, MIME sniffing attacks, and XSS.
- **Fix:** Configure security headers in Spring Security or at the API Gateway level.

### 9. Self-Signed Certificate Accepted in Production Code
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** `web-app/src/services/socket-service.ts` (line 31)
- **Description:** Socket connections accept self-signed certificates with `rejectUnauthorized: false`
- **Evidence:**
  ```typescript
  rejectUnauthorized: false // Only for development with self-signed certs
  ```
- **Impact:** Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks if this configuration remains in production.
- **Fix:** Remove this setting in production environments and use properly signed certificates.

### 10. Insufficient Input Validation in Backend
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Location:** Various controller endpoints
- **Description:** While frontend validation exists using Zod, corresponding comprehensive backend validation may be missing.
- **Impact:** Malicious requests could bypass frontend validation and potentially cause data corruption or injection attacks.
- **Fix:** Implement thorough input validation on the backend using Bean Validation annotations or custom validators.

## Risk Assessment Summary

| Severity | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Critical | 1     | 10.0%      |
| High     | 2     | 20.0%      |
| Medium   | 6     | 60.0%      |
| Low      | 1     | 10.0%      |

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix CORS configuration** to restrict origins, methods, and headers
2. **Enable CSRF protection** for state-changing operations
3. **Move JWT secret** to environment variables or secure storage
4. **Implement secure token storage** in frontend using HttpOnly cookies
5. **Update vulnerable dependencies** to latest secure versions
6. **Add rate limiting** on authentication endpoints
7. **Remove insecure SSL configurations** from production code

## Best Practices to Prevent Vulnerabilities

### Secure Coding Standards
- Follow OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- Implement comprehensive input validation at all entry points
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing

### Security Testing
- Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code reviews with security focus
- Penetration testing before production releases

### Infrastructure Security
- Use secure secret management systems (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Regular security updates and patches
- Monitor and log security events

### Development Process
- Security training for development team
- Threat modeling for new features
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response planning

## Conclusion

The Easy Bites application has multiple security vulnerabilities that should be addressed before production deployment. While many of these issues are common in development environments, they represent significant risks if deployed to production. Implementing the recommended fixes and following security best practices will significantly improve the application's security posture.

**Recommendation:** Implement all critical and high-severity fixes before deploying to production, and establish a timeline for addressing medium and low-severity issues.
